# I'm a software developer specializing in machine learning.

At my current role I am responsible for the novel deep learning technology that powers our products. I am a lead author on four [published patents](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10650275B2/en) that relate to deep learning for visual anomaly detection. I have also designed and implemented custom machine learning solutions for clients that have included DARPA and Fortune 100 companies. 

My experience also includes applying machine learning to financial, sports, [genetic](https://github.com/remingm/promoter-lstm), and [infectious disease data](https://github.com/remingm/covid19-correlations-forecast). I take machine learning systems from design to implementation to live deployment.

Feel free to contact me.
