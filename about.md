## I'm a recent computer science graduate seeking a workplace that will benefit from my skill set.

I have a strong skill set with emphasis in writing clean code to build systems that solve complex problems. In my undergraduate machine learning research lab I played a core role in building an effective system for data organization, processing, modeling, and prediction. Additionally, I am used to rapidly learning and implementing new technologies and frameworks.
