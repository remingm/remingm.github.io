<!-- # I'm a software developer specializing in machine learning. -->

I'm currently on contract with [Chiral Software](https://chiralsoftware.com/), though I will be available for full-time work in 2017.

<!-- I currently do contract work as a machine learning and software developer, building custom solutions that are tailored to my client's data and needs.  -->

In my machine learning research lab I played a core role in building an effective system for data organization, processing, modeling, prediction, and visualization. My machine learning experience includes text classification, image recognition, sports prediction, genetic analysis, and economic forecasting among other projects.

Additionally, I am used to rapidly learning and implementing new technologies and frameworks. I have a solid algorithms and programming background as well as experience with web development.

Feel free to contact me.
