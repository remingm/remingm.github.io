## I'm a recent computer science graduate seeking a full-time position.

I currently do contract work as a machine learning and software developer, building custom solutions that are tailored to my client's data and needs. 

In my machine learning research lab I played a core role in building an effective system for data organization, processing, modeling, prediction, and visualization. My machine learning experience includes text classification, image recognition, sports prediction, genetic analysis, and economic forecasting among other projects.

Additionally, I am used to rapidly learning and implementing new technologies and frameworks. I have a solid algorithms and programming background as well as experience with web development.

Feel free to contact me if you feel that my skill set could benefit your needs.
