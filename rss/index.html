The &#x201C;Vaccinated&#x201D; bar above is about 5% of the length of the &#x201C;Placebo&#x201D; bar. Put another way, 0.046/0.925 = 5%, and 100-5 = 95%.</p><p>So <strong>95% efficacy doesn&#x2019;t mean 5% chance of failure, but that there was a 95% improvement compared to the unvaccinated group.</strong> This is called relative risk reduction.</p><p>If not 5%, then what was the chance of getting Covid-19 in the vaccinated group? 8 out of 17,411 tested positive in the vaccinated group, or 0.046%. That is about 100 times less than 5%.</p><p>Now let&#x2019;s look at absolute risk reduction. In the unvaccinated placebo group, the chance of testing positive was 0.925%, and in the vaccinated group it was 0.046%. So the vaccine reduced the fraction of cases by 0.925% &#x2013; 0.046% = 0.879%.</p><p>An article in The Lancet medical journal gives the same numbers, but rounded:</p><blockquote>with a cumulated COVID-19 attack rate over a period of 3 months of about 1% without a vaccine, we would expect roughly 0.05% of vaccinated people would get diseased. It does not mean that 95% of people are protected from disease with the vaccine&#x2014;a general misconception of vaccine protection</blockquote><p>To summarize:<strong> Over the duration of this trial, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine reduced the absolute risk of getting Covid-19 from 0.925% to 0.046%, representing a 95% reduction in relative risk. </strong></p><p>Note that <strong>these probabilities only apply to the duration of the trial</strong>.

[<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2772168">2</a>]</li><li>Herd immunity also protects those who are unable to be vaccinated, such as newborns and immunocompromised people, because the disease spread within the population is very limited.

Cases only represent a fraction of known infections, since not all infected people get tested. Luckily Youyang Gu, one of the top Covid-19 modelers, has presented a <a href="https://covid19-projections.com/estimating-true-infections-revisited/">simple equation for estimating true infections</a>. To use this equation we need the daily percentage of positive tests and the daily number of new cases.</p><p>Many who get vaccinated have already been infected. It&apos;s impossible to know the exact overlap, but if we don&apos;t estimate it then our immunity estimate will be too high. One of the <a href="https://covid19-projections.com/path-to-herd-immunity/">top modelers</a> assumes 50% of vaccinations go to recovered infections.
