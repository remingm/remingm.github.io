Thankfully, the answer is no.</p><p>For this post I&#x2019;ll examine Pfizer-BioNTech data, but the same logic applies to Moderna and other trials. The 95% number comes from table 9 of the Pfizer-BioNTech briefing document available at fda.gov.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-21-at-5.28.29-PM.png" class="kg-image" alt="What Does 95% Effectiveness Mean?

The &#x201C;Vaccinated&#x201D; bar above is about 5% of the length of the &#x201C;Placebo&#x201D; bar. Put another way, 0.046/0.925 = 5%, and 100-5 = 95%.</p><p>So <strong>95% efficacy doesn&#x2019;t mean 5% chance of failure, but that there was a 95% improvement compared to the unvaccinated group.</strong> This is called relative risk reduction.</p><p>If not 5%, then what was the chance of getting Covid-19 in the vaccinated group? 8 out of 17,411 tested positive in the vaccinated group, or 0.046%. That is about 100 times less than 5%. </p><p>Now let&#x2019;s look at absolute risk reduction. In the unvaccinated placebo group, the chance of testing positive was 0.925%, and in the vaccinated group it was 0.046%. So the vaccine reduced the fraction of cases by 0.925% &#x2013; 0.046% = 0.879%.</p><p>An article in The Lancet medical journal gives the same numbers, but rounded:</p><blockquote>with a cumulated COVID-19 attack rate over a period of 3 months of about 1% without a vaccine, we would expect roughly 0.05% of vaccinated people would get diseased. It does not mean that 95% of people are protected from disease with the vaccine&#x2014;a general misconception of vaccine protection</blockquote><p>To summarize:<strong> In this trial, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine reduced the absolute risk of getting Covid-19 from 0.925% to 0.046%, representing a 95% reduction in relative risk.</strong></p><p>Another thing to note, all vaccines were 100% effective at preventing hospitalization and death from Covid-19.</p><h3 id="references">References:</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(21)00075-X/fulltext?rss=yes&amp;utm_campaign=update-laninf&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=112512455&amp;utm_content=112512455&amp;utm_source=hs_email#back-bib4"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">What does 95% COVID-19 vaccine efficacy really mean?</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">It is imperative to dispel any ambiguity about how vaccine efficacy shown in trialstranslates into protecting individuals and populations.
