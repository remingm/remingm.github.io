In this article I&apos;ll use a clustering algorithm to group US states based on trends in Covid-19 hospitalizations and other metrics. Some groupings are surprising and invite further investigation. Why would a state have a different trend than its neighbors? Why would some distant states have similar trends? These results may hint at patterns of interstate travel during the pandemic.</p><p>First we&apos;ll explore the hospitalization trend groupings, then we&apos;ll add more metrics involving cases and deaths. Lastly, we&apos;ll dive into how the project works. </p><h2 id="data-preprocessing">Data Preprocessing</h2><p>All data was scaled from 0-1 to account for population differences. We are looking at similar hospitalization trends and timing, not similar numbers hospitalized.

A potential improvement would involve clustering in all five dimensions and reducing dimensions only for visualization.
